This is a collection of templates for making games using the Allegro library, meant for use as "User templates" inside Code::Blocks IDE.

Installation
============

For basic installation on Linux, just git-clone to the folder that is located in ~/.config/.codeblocks/UserTemplates (or ~/.codeblocks/UserTemplates if using an older version).

On Windows, the folder is located at %APPDATA%\codeblocks\UserTemplates.

Features
========

* Fixed-rate and automatic frame skipping.
* Checks return value for each module initialization.
* Game state implementation with a stack.
* Separate state_load() and state_free() functions for resource loading and freeing respectively.
* A default "STATE_GAME" already created, as an example.
* Toggle between full-screen and window mode with F4 key (Allegro 5).
* Supports Linux, Windows and DOS (Allegro 4) as targets.
* DOS target needs a DJGPP cross-compiler.

The "low-res" Allegro 5 template is meant for small-resolution games (such as 320x200). The window is up-scaled to fit the monitor size, but will not cover it entirely.
