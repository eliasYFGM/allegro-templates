This is a collection of templates for making games using the Allegro library,
meant for use as "User templates" inside the Code::Blocks IDE.

Installation
============

For basic installation on Linux, just git-clone to the folder that is located
in ~/.config/.codeblocks/UserTemplates (or ~/.codeblocks/UserTemplates if
using an older version).

On Windows, the folder is located at %APPDATA%\codeblocks\UserTemplates.

Features
========

 * Fixed-rate and automatic frame skipping.
 * Checks return value for each module initialization.
 * Game state implementation with a stack.
 * Separate state_load() and state_free() functions for resource loading and
   freeing respectively.
 * A default "STATE_GAME" already created, as an example.
 * Toggle between full-screen and window mode with F4 key (Allegro 5).
 * Supports Linux, Windows and DOS as targets.
 * DOS target is only for Allegro 4 -needs a DJGPP cross-compiler-

Notes
=====

The Allegro 5 tempÄºate does not have auto-scaling. As of 2017-08-14, the
"low-res" Allegro 5 template is no longer available.

For retro-style games, I recommend using Allegro 4, as it has auto-scaling
already implemented in the template.
