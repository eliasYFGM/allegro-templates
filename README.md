# Allegro Game Templates

These templates implement a basic game-state pattern with global functions, in C, and a "Game" class in C++.

## Naming

[al4~]: Default C++ templates for Allegro 4.x (Linux, Windows and DOS).

[al5~]: Default C++ templates for Allegro 5.x (Linux and Windows).

[~c]: Templates in pure C. These require a C99 compiler or GNU GCC.

[~r]: Templates for retro-games in mind that run with a small resolution. The game window is up-scaled automatically (by default) to fit almost the entire monitor resolution. No full-screen at the moment.
