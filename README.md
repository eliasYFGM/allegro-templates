# Allegro Game Templates
This is a collection of templates that I made for game projects using Allegro. Some of them were originally made for my own projects and prototypes. A Code::Blocks project file is included for every template so you can just git-clone into your default "UserTemplates" folder (starting with 16.01, the folder is located in ~/.config/codeblocks under Linux).

They implement a basic state-machine with global functions to manipulate states in C, and a "Game" class in C++.

## Naming

[al4~]: Allegro 4.x (can target Linux, Windows and DOS).

[al5~]: Allegro 5.x (Linux and Windows).

[c]: Templates for pure C. They are slightly more polished than C++ though.

[r]: Templates for retro-games in mind that run with a small resolution. The game window is up-scaled automatically (by default) depending on the monitor's resolution. No full-screen at the moment.
