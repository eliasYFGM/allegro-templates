# Allegro Game Templates
A4 and A5 templates for game development.

a(4/5): Basic template that provides init, update, draw and shutdown functions in the same "main" file.

a(4/5)s: A more complete template that provides a game-state mechanism and a default Game_Engine class. States can be interacted with change_state, push_state and pop_state functions.

a(4/5)sc: C version of the above template. Provides the same functionality as the C++ version, but the code is entirely in C.
